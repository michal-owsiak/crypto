## **Architecture**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Overview**

The project is built around a modular ELT pipeline with clear separation
of responsibilities:

-   Data ingestion from external sources (`Binance API` and `AWS S3`)
-   Storage in a cloud-based data warehouse (`Snowflake`)
-   Transformation and testing using `dbt`
-   Orchestration with `Apache Airflow`
-   Serving layer via `Streamlit` application
-   Deployment and infrastructure using `Docker` and cloud hosting
-   CI/CD integration via `GitHub Actions`

The pipeline is designed to operate incrementally using a watermark
(last timestamp), ensuring efficient processing and avoiding full data
reloads.

## **Application**

![Application](./app_screenshot.jpg)

### **Key Components**

- **Bitcoin Price Chart (Weekly and Daily Timeframes)**
  - Main analytical view focused on long-term trends
  - Weekly granularity is used to reduce noise and support strategic decision-making
  - Daily interval is available for deeper analysis when needed

- **Supertrend Indicator**
  - Primary analytical tool used in the application
  - Helps identify long-term trend direction and potential reversal points
  - Has proven effective in capturing major market cycles

- **Market Summary**
  - Aggregated view of market metrics
  - Provides quick situational awareness for the current market state

- **Whale Inflow Monitoring**
  - Tracks large-volume movements on the blockchain
  - Based on on-chain data
  - Updated hourly to help detect potential accumulation or distribution phases

### **Design Assumptions**

The application is optimized for long-term investing:

- Focus on higher timeframes (weekly data)
- Limited need for high-frequency ingestion (daily batches are sufficient)
- Separation of data sources:
  - market data (daily)
  - blockchain data (hourly)

This design ensures that the data pipeline directly supports the analytical goals of the application.
